<details><summary><h3>üåû What is bluepilot?</h3></summary>

---

[bluepilot](https://github.com/bluepilotdev/bluepilot) is a fork of the hugely popular SunnyPilot project for the Comma3 and Comma3X.  The goal of BluePilot is to develop, test, and stage Ford specific enhancements, validating them before submission to the SunnyPilot team for inclusion in the parent project.

</details>

<details><summary><h3>‚õî Prohibited Safety Modifications</h3></summary>

---

All [official sunnypilot branches](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot/branches) strictly adhere to [comma.ai's safety policy](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/SAFETY.md). Any changes that go against this policy will result in your fork and your device being banned from both comma.ai and sunnypilot channels. This same stipulation applies to all bluepilot instances as well.

The following changes are a **VIOLATION** of this policy and **ARE NOT** included in any sunnypilot branches:
* Driver Monitoring:
    * ‚ùå "Nerfing" or reducing monitoring parameters.
* Panda safety:
    * ‚ùå No preventing disengaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal press.
    * ‚ùå No auto re-engaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal release.
    * ‚ùå No disengaging on ACC MAIN in OFF state.

<details><summary><h3>üöó Highlight Features</h3></summary>

---
In addition to all sunnypilot features, bluepilot incorporates the following Ford specific enhacements.

- [**Improved Ford Longitudinal controls**] - logic to adjust stock OpenPilot single acceleration signal into seperate gas and brake signals for much smoother long control on ford vehicles.
- [**Anti-Windup in Turns**] - Logic to reset the EPAS back to zero when a human turn is detected.  This prevents the EPAS from winding up and fighting to keep turning after the car has straightened up.  Makes experimental mode and MADS safer to use.
- [**Anti Ping Pong Logic**] - Applies a blend of desired curvature and predicted curvature when no curves have been detected for at least the next 3 seconds.  This greatly reduce steering wheel wiggle and ping pong.
- [**Less Aggressive Lane Changes**] - utilizes a blend of desired curvature and predicted curvature to achieve smoother, less aggressive lane changes.
