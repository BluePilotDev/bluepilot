# Fleet Manager

Fleet Manger on sunnypilot allows viewing dashcam footage, screen recordings, and error logs by connecting to the comma device via the same network, with your mobile device or PC. Big thanks to [actuallylemoncurd](https://github.com/actuallylemoncurd), [AlexandreSato](https://github.com/alexandreSato), [ntegan1](https://github.com/ntegan1), and [royjr](https://github.com/royjr).

The network can be set up by Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot, or tethering on the comma device. Navigate to http://tici:5050/ OR http://ipAddress:5050 to access.
